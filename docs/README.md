# Amalia

Amalia is a extensible and versatile HTML5 multimedia player that allows you to view any type of metadata along with your video or audio streams. 
It follows the responsive design guidelines. Although initially developed as a tool to visualize the metadata extracted automatically by our algorithms (you can see some prototypes online), we believe it can be useful more broadly.
Amalia is composed of three main parts :
- the core player
- the unified metadata format
- the visualization plugins
